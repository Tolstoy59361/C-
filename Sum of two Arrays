Two random integer arrays/lists have been given as ARR1 and ARR2 of size N and M respectively. Both the arrays/lists contain numbers from 0 to 9(i.e. single digit integer is present at every index). The idea here is to represent each array/list as an integer in itself of digits N and M.
You need to find the sum of both the input arrays/list treating them as two integers and put the result in another array/list i.e. output array/list will also contain only single digit at every index.

void sumOfTwoArrays(int *input1, int size1, int *input2, int s
{
 int i = size1 - 1;
 int j = size2 - 1;
 int carry = 0;
 int k = max(size1, size2); //k is the current index of the
 while (i >= 0 && j >= 0)
 {
 int sum = input1[i] + input2[j] + carry;
 output[k] = sum % 10;
 carry = sum / 10;
 i--;
 j--;
 k--;
 }
 while(i>=0)
 {
 int sum = input1[i] + carry;
 output[k] = sum % 10;
 carry = sum / 10;
 i--;
 k--;
 }
 while (j >= 0)
 {
 int sum = input2[j] + carry;
 output[k] = sum % 10;
 carry = sum / 10;
 j--;
 k--;
 }
 output[0] = carry;
}
